Following is the user switch command that can be used to switch from one user to another

  

```bash

su - username

```

  

```bash

su - invokes a login shell after switching the user. A login shell resets most environment variables, providing a clean base.

```

  

```bash

su username - just switches the user, providing a normal shell with an environment nearly the same as with the old user
