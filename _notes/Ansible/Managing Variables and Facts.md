Create a vars/secret.yml file, encrypted with Ansible Vault. Use the password redhat to
encrypt it. It should set the web_pass variable to redhat, which is the web user's password.

Create a subdirectory named vars in the working directory.

```bash

[student@workstation data-review]$ mkdir vars

```

Create the encrypted variable file, vars/secret.yml, using Ansible Vault. Set the
password for the encrypted file to redhat.


```bash

[student@workstation data-review]$ ansible-vault create vars/secret.yml
New Vault password: redhat
Confirm New Vault password: redhat

```




Add the following variable definition to the file:

```yaml

web_pass: redhat

```

Save and close the file.

Run the playbook.yml playbook. Verify that content is successfully returned from the web
server, and that it matches what was configured in an earlier task.

Before running the playbook, verify that its syntax is correct by running ansible navigator with the --syntax-check option.
Use --vault-id @prompt to be prompted for the Vault password. Enter redhat
when prompted for the password.
If it reports any errors, correct them before moving to the next step.
You should see output similar to the following:


```bash

[student@workstation data-review]$ ansible-navigator run -m stdout \
> --playbook-artifact-enable false \
> playbook.yml --syntax-check --vault-id @prompt
Vault password (default): redhat
playbook: /home/student/data-review/playbook.yml

```



Using the ansible-navigator command, run the playbook with the --vault-id
@prompt option. Enter redhat when prompted for the password.


```bash
[student@workstation data-review]$ ansible-navigator run -m stdout \
> --playbook-artifact-enable false \
> playbook.yml --vault-id @prompt
Vault password: redhat
