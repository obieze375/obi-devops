## Commonly Used Parameters for the User Module

comment: Optionally sets the description of a user account.

group: Optionally sets the user's primary group.

groups: Optionally sets a list of supplementary groups for the user.

When set to a null value, all groups except the primary group
are removed. 

home: Optionally sets the user's home directory location. 

create_home: Optionally takes a Boolean value of true or false. A home
directory is created for the user if the value is set to true.

system: Optionally takes a Boolean value of true or false. When
creating an account, this makes the user a system account if
the value is set to true. This setting cannot be changed on
existing users.

uid: Sets the UID number of the user.

state: If set to present, create the account if it is missing (the
default setting). 

If set to absent, remove the account if it is
present.
